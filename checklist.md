# Wallet Tracker Bot Development Checklist

## ✅ **Basic Setup**
- [x] Create a Conda environment and initialize a Git repository.
- [x] Set up a `LICENSE` file with a custom non-commercial license.
- [x] Configure a `README.md` file with:
  - [x] Project description.
  - [x] Features and usage instructions.
  - [x] Contribution guidelines.
  - [x] Contact information.

## ✅ **Telegram Bot Integration**
- [ ] Register the bot with Telegram's [BotFather](https://core.telegram.org/bots#botfather) and obtain an API token.
- [ ] Install the `python-telegram-bot` library for Telegram API integration.
- [ ] Implement the following bot commands:
  - [ ] `/start`: Welcome message with usage instructions.
  - [ ] `/help`: Detailed help message.
  - [ ] `/add <wallet_address>`: Add a wallet to the tracking list.
  - [ ] `/remove <wallet_address>`: Remove a wallet from the tracking list.
  - [ ] `/list`: List all tracked wallets.

## ✅ **Wallet Tracking Functionality**
- [ ] Integrate with the Solana RPC API or a third-party Solana API (e.g., [Solana Beach](https://solanabeach.io/)).
- [ ] Fetch wallet transaction history and real-time updates.
- [ ] Parse transaction details:
  - [ ] Transaction type (incoming/outgoing).
  - [ ] Amount of SOL or tokens transferred.
  - [ ] Timestamp and block number.
  - [ ] Sender and receiver addresses.
- [ ] Store transaction data securely for comparison and notification logic.

## ✅ **Notification System**
- [ ] Implement real-time notifications for:
  - [ ] Incoming transactions.
  - [ ] Outgoing transactions.
  - [ ] Large transfers (configurable threshold).
- [ ] Allow users to configure notification preferences:
  - [ ] Disable/enable specific alerts (e.g., only notify for incoming transactions).
  - [ ] Set thresholds for large transaction alerts.

## ✅ **User Subscription Management**
- [ ] Use a database (e.g., PostgreSQL, SQLite) to store user subscriptions:
  - [ ] Telegram user ID.
  - [ ] List of tracked wallet addresses.
  - [ ] Notification preferences.
- [ ] Ensure unique user-wallet mappings to avoid duplication.

## ✅ **Security**
- [ ] Use environment variables to store sensitive data (e.g., API keys, Telegram bot token).
- [ ] Validate wallet addresses before adding them to the tracking list.
- [ ] Prevent abuse by limiting the number of wallets a user can track.

## ✅ **Backend Architecture**
- [ ] Implement a periodic task system to poll wallet activity:
  - [ ] Use a scheduler like `APScheduler` or `Celery`.
  - [ ] Optimize polling intervals to minimize API usage.
- [ ] Use WebSocket connections if supported by the API for real-time tracking.
- [ ] Implement logging for tracking bot performance and debugging:
  - [ ] Log user interactions.
  - [ ] Log API requests and responses.

## ✅ **Frontend (Bot User Experience)**
- [ ] Design clear and concise bot responses for all commands.
- [ ] Use buttons for user interactions where appropriate:
  - [ ] Inline buttons to add/remove wallets.
  - [ ] Settings menu for notification preferences.
- [ ] Add error handling and user-friendly error messages:
  - [ ] Invalid wallet address.
  - [ ] API connectivity issues.
  - [ ] Exceeded wallet tracking limit.

## ✅ **Testing**
- [ ] Write unit tests for critical functions:
  - [ ] Command handling.
  - [ ] API integration.
  - [ ] Notification logic.
- [ ] Perform manual testing for:
  - [ ] All commands.
  - [ ] Notification delivery.
  - [ ] Multi-user functionality.
- [ ] Test edge cases (e.g., invalid wallet addresses, large-scale transactions).

## ✅ **Deployment**
- [ ] Use a hosting platform like AWS, Heroku, or DigitalOcean.
- [ ] Set up a CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments.
- [ ] Use a process manager like `systemd` or `PM2` to keep the bot running.
- [ ] Enable HTTPS for secure API communications.

## ✅ **Future Features (Optional)**
- [ ] Support multiple blockchains (e.g., Ethereum, Bitcoin).
- [ ] Provide analytics and statistics for tracked wallets.
- [ ] Add premium features (e.g., higher tracking limits, advanced notifications).

## ✅ **Documentation**
- [ ] Create a detailed guide for setting up and using the bot.
- [ ] Document the API integration process.
- [ ] Provide a troubleshooting FAQ for common issues.

---

### **Notes**
- Keep the bot’s responses polished and professional to enhance user experience.
- Regularly update the bot to incorporate user feedback and new Solana API features.
